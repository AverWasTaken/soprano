// block and disagreed on the verdict (see WoodBudget for the same cure on wood). this is the one home: MinecraftFacts builds it in
// refresh() (the world half asks the game, this class only does arithmetic over the registry), GamerContext.stations() hands it out.
// it is immutable. the only thing its construction writes is the StationLatches it is handed: the hysteresis lives here and nowhere else.
//
// it carries the held flags and nothing else, because nothing else is read. what is NOT in it on purpose: the per-bench decisions
// (WorkbenchRules.decide moves the bench's clocks and reads the phase's plan, so it stays in Workbenches.run), idle / in use (they ask
// the task tree), the container tasks' own choice (StationChoice is alto's, it runs on candidates the task builds from the tracker) and
// phaseMayEnd (the isDone predicates and PortalPhase ask AFTER the tick's pickups moved the registry and have no ctx, so a value built
// in refresh() would answer one tick late: they call Workbenches.phaseMayEnd)

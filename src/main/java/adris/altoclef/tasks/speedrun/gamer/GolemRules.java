// the numbers and decisions of the golem hunt with no minecraft in them, so a test can poke them. all of the vanilla
// facts below were read out of the 1.21.4 mojmap jar, not remembered:
//  - iron golem is 1.4 wide and 2.7 tall (EntityType.IRON_GOLEM sized(1.4, 2.7)), 100 hp, knockback resistance 1
//  - Mob.getAttackBoundingBox is its own box inflated by DEFAULT_ATTACK_REACH (sqrt(2.04) - 0.6 = 0.828) in x and z
//    and by ZERO in y, and isWithinMeleeAttackRange is an AABB.intersects (strict) against our hitbox. so the whole
//    question is "is our hitbox bottom below the golem's head", nothing about horizontal distance saves us
//  - MeleeAttackGoal.canUse is true with a partial path or in range, so a golem under a pillar keeps coming and
//    stands against it, it just can never get its box up to our feet
//  - Player.canInteractWithEntity is the distance from our EYE to the nearest point of the golem's box against the
//    entity interaction range, 3.0 in survival. the server is looser (it asks with a 3.0 buffer) but we play fair

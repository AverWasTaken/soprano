// the one place IRON decides "what are we doing right now". same deal as CombatCommit for fights: one way in, one way out,
// nothing in between lets go. the jobs keep their own insides (ResourceDetour, VillageLoot, GolemHunt, FurnaceWatch...), this only
// says WHICH of them gets asked. pure, IronPhase is the thin driver that asks the jobs in the order this hands it.
//
// the rule: the kit is the floor, anything eligible above it takes the wheel. anything else, once it has the wheel, holds it
// until its own end (its job hands back null: done, gave up, out of budget) or something allowed to cut in shows up: the finishing
// at a station cuts in on anything (a half taken furnace is how stations got left behind), a quick smoker stand-by cuts in on the
// side jobs below it (see preempts). combat is a chain of its own and sits above all of this already. one shared hysteresis
// rule: something that ended on its own sits out REST_TICKS before it can start again

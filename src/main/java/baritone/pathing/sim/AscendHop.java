// when to press space for a one block hop up, asked of the sim instead of guessed. a sprint hop spends its first two moves
// (about 0.77 of a block) still below the top of the step, so it clips the face if it starts too close, and it comes down
// against the face if it starts too far back: there is a window about two blocks wide, and the old rules ("jump the moment
// the ceiling is clear", "jump inside 1.2 blocks") are somewhere in or near it depending on where in the cell the last
// movement happened to hand over. a clip is a horizontal collision vanilla does not call minor, which costs the sprint and
// all the speed with it
//
// standing inside the near edge of that window (flush against the face is the extreme) no wait fixes it, the hop can't back
// up. the brake does: W held with the yaw turned round, which 26.3 does not count as letting go of forward (only the input
// is looked at, not where it points), so the sprint survives and the player accelerates backwards. a few ticks of that, then

// the keys a hop up a step asked for, checked against the sim one tick at a time. a staircase of full blocks lands you a
// fraction of a block from the next face every time, so "W and space" clips it on every single step (a wall hit that vanilla
// does not call minor, which ends the sprint). the sim says when that is the case and what to press instead: let go of W for
// a tick, or stand still until the next hop is a clean one. in the sim sweep of a 6 step staircase this was zero wall hits
// from every start in exactly as many ticks as holding W and clipping, which was about one clip a step. the sprint is off for
// about a tick a step either way (letting go of W costs it as much as the wall did), the staircase is just like that.
// AscendHop picks the moment on the ground, this is the safety net under it for whatever it does not know (chains of steps,
// a landing that is too close)
